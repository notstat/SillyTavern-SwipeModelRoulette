Ever swiped in a roleplay and noticed the swipe was 90% similar to the last one? Me too. This extension helps with that.

## What it does

Automatically switches between different AI models when you swipe, giving you more varied responses. Each swipe uses a random model based on the weights you set.

## Installation

1. Paste this link in SillyTavern's extension installer:
   ```
   https://github.com/notstat/SwipeModelRoulette

2. Add at least one connection profile in SillyTavern to use this extension

3. Set the percentages for each model in the extension settings

That's it. Now your swipes will automatically use different models.
